![US_IT_Salary_2016](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123023512/223044007-ff7010de-22c5-4ccf-b1d2-26e80e5cd779.png)

After removing the outliers, the distribution became much clearer than before. We can easily local the numbers we want from the data set, the median of total income would be $105000, the upper hinge would be $137000 and the lower hinge would be $75000.

According to the statistic from the U.S. census, the Annual mean salary per employee in the U.S. in 2016 was $60,826. As a result, we can see the mean of the IT industry's annual base pay($97783) is round 160% of the mean salary.

If we compare it with the total income of the year($106223), it would be 180% of the mean salary. This means as an employee in the IT industry your salary is significantly higher than the average.

Unfortunately, we are unable to see a clear relationship between experience and the total income. However we can still find a trend from the scatter gram, if you got more experience in the industry the income would be generous.
