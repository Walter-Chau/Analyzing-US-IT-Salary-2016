# After removing the outliers, the distribution became much clearer than before.
# We can easily local the numbers we want from the data set, the mean of total income would be $110000, the upper quarter would be $140000 and the lower quarter would be $75000.

# According to the statistic from the U.S. census, the Annual mean salary per employee in the U.S. in 2016 was $60,826. As a result, we can see the mean of the IT industry's annual base pay($100000) is 164% of the mean salary. 
# If we compare it with the total income of the year($106223), it would be 180% of the mean salary. This means as an employee in the IT industry your salary is significantly higher than the average.

# We are unable to see a clear relationship between experience and the total income, however we can still find a trend from the scatter gram. If you got more experience in the industry the income would be generous.
